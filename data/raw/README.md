# Raw Data Directory

The `raw` directory contains the original, unprocessed data files used in the oversold value zone strategy. These files are typically sourced from various data providers and are stored in their original format.

## Structure

- Each data file should be named according to its content and date of acquisition.
- It is recommended to keep the raw data files organized by date or type to facilitate easy access and management.

## Usage

- Do not modify the files in this directory. Any changes should be made to the processed data files located in the `processed` directory.
- Ensure that any new raw data files added to this directory follow the naming conventions established for consistency.
