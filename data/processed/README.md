# Processed Data Files

This directory contains processed data files that have been cleaned, transformed, and are ready for analysis or modeling. 

## Structure

- Each processed data file is typically in CSV format and contains data that has been derived from the raw data files.
- The naming convention for processed files follows the pattern: `processed_<data_type>_<date>.csv`, where `<data_type>` indicates the type of data and `<date>` represents the date of processing.

## Usage

- Processed data files can be used directly in the analysis scripts or for training machine learning models.
- Ensure that the data is up-to-date and reflects the latest transformations applied to the raw data.

## Note

- It is recommended to document any transformations or processing steps applied to the raw data in the corresponding scripts or notebooks for reproducibility.
